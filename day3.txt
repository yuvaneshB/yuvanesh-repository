Today is the third day session start,it's usefull for my learning and understand lot of new process in this session.Today work will be start learn in sdlc(software development life cycle) process,i learn about create a planning,how to defining,desining,building,testing and deployment and maintenance.
it's all the process are use in testing, planning for the quality assurance requirement and identification of the risk associated with the project is also done in the planing  stages.then defining process is anailysis done the next step to clearly define and document the project requirement. it will done through an SRS(software requirement specification)document,all the project requirement to be designing and developed during the project.designing is srs is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. Building in the stage of sdlc the actual development start the product is build then the programming code generate as per DDS(design document specification) during the stage.To testing the all the stages subset as in the modern software development life cycle models testing activities are mously involved in all stages of software development life cycle this stage refer to the testing only stage of the product.Finally deployment and maintennance the process once the process to tester and ready to deployed,it is relesed formally in the appropiate market and mainten the process clear customer querys and solving the process.
